Melt-spinning, extrusion, wet spinning and dry-jet wet spinning techniques is used to produce fibres or tapes. The evaluation of structure through thermo-mechanical properties, polymer solution rheology and microscopic analysis of materials is carried out using established methods.", "credits": "1 (0-0-2)", "pre": "TXL212/TXL211"}
