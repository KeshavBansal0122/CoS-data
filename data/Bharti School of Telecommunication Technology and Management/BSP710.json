Group-based term projects such as advanced coding schemes (LDPC, Turbo, RS, Polar, etc.) in conjunction with Demapper using Soft-decision/Hard-decision principles building a complete end to end system: design of band-pass processors for cell phone application, sample implementation of OFDM waveform TX and RX \u2013 like Wifi-6 o LTE. Sample implementation of single carrier waveform (DVB-S2. Cable/QAM, Doesis) both for RX and TX, design of audio codec, design of rake receiver- all could be implemented on FPGA or DSP such as ARM processor.", "credits": "3 (0-1-4)", "pre": "ELL205, ELL411"}
