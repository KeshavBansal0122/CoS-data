The students would have to go through the full cycle of specification, design and prototyping/building a concept demonstrator. Key component of the assessment would be through a public demonstration of their solution.\n\nLearning to work in groups as well as planning and delivering a large task are other expected learnings.", "credits": "4 (0-1-6)"}
