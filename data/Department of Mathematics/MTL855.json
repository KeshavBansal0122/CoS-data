Indifference zone formulation : Ranking normal population in terms of means single and two stage procedures. Ranking normal population in terms of variances. Ranking binomial population-fixed sample size and multistage procedures, play the winner rules and vector at a time sampling. Ranking Gamma population with largest (smallest) scale parameter. Optimal properties of fixed subset size proceduresBayes, minimax and admissibilities properties, subset selection formulation : Decision theoretical formulation, best invariant rules. Restricted subset selection. Subset selection of normal population w.r.t. means and variances, selection of t-best. Subset selection in binomial and gamma populations. Comparison of population with a control. Normal and exponential populations.\n\nMTL856 Lie Algebras 3 Credits (3-0-0) Overlaps with: MTL756\n\nDefinitions and examples. Basic concepts.
