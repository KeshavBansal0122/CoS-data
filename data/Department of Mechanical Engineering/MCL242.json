Unified view of momentum, heat and mass transfer.\n\nConduction: Fourier\u2019s law, heat diffusion equation, 1-D steady state conduction in extended surfaces, heat generation, lumped capacitance and 1D transient models, semi-infinite wall. Diffusion mass transfer in 1D: steady state and transient.\n\nConvection: Forced and free convection - mass, momentum and energy conservation equations, scaling analysis and significance of non-dimensional numbers, thermal boundary layers, heat transfer in external and internal laminar and turbulent flows, and use of correlations. Convective mass transfer. Boiling and condensation: physical phenomena and correlations.\n\nHeat exchanger types and analysis: LMTD and effectiveness-NTU method. Radiation: properties, Laws, view factor, 3-surface network for diffuse- gray surfaces. Gas radiation.", "credits": "4 (3-1-0)", "pre": "MCL140 & APL106", "overlap": "CLL251"}
