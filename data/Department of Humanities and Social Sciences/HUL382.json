{"department": "Department of Humanities and Social Sciences", "name": "HUL382 Romanticism: The Theory of Animals, Monsters and Machines", "description": "There is more to romanticism than Wordsworth\u2019s poetry, or even literature in general. Nor is it confined between 1780s and 1830s. Least is it a trend succeeded by Victorianism and realism, and assailed by modernism. Romanticism contends with the question of presentation \u2013 of representation of and to oneself. It therefore directly participates in the philosophical discussions of reason, sensibility, emotion, subjectivity, and most importantly the idea of human freedom. This course will familiarize students with romantic movements in arts, in theories of language and society, in post- Kantian philosophy, in attitudes tor religion. Romantics not only engaged in experimental social practices and literary collaborations, but also articulated their necessity for the first time. Can we say that romanticism is at an end? How does it contribute to both a nationalism rooted in folk tradition, and individualism expressed in the cult of the hero, the solitary intellectual? How does it both look back to medieval occult and forward to novelties of science? Why is romanticism fascinated with animals, monsters and machines alike?", "credits": "3 (3-0-0)", "allocPref": "HUL231, HUL235", "pre": "Any Two courses from HUL2XX category "}
