A range of socio- political thinkers, theories and concepts will be taught. It will provide a broad survey of fundamental social and political questions in current contexts discussing philosophical issues central to political thought and radical critiques of current political theories.", "credits": "4 (3-1-0)", "pre": "NLN101"}
