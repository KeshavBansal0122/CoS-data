{"department": "Department of Humanities and Social Sciences", "name": "HUL778 Urban Sociology", "description": "This seminar course critically examines the production of urban space and culture. The \u2018urban\u2019 denotes an aspect of physical space as much as a way of life and a mentality. A critical reading of ethnographic studies on the city provides a cross-cultural perspective on how space becomes culturally meaningful. The rise of the urban centre and metropolis are the product of a certain historical moment, yet they also produce distinctive mentalities and cultures that are unique to them.\n\nThe course will explore the structuring and contestation of urban space through categories of class, ethnicity, status and gender and study the city as the location of discourses of and struggles for citizenship.", "credits": "3 (3-0-0)"}
