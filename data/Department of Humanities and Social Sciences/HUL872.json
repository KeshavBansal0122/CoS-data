{"department": "Department of Humanities and Social Sciences", "name": "HUL872 Sexuality, Governmentality, and the State", "description": "Sexual governance or state surveillance of issues pertaining to sexuality, marriage and mobility highlight the problematic division between the \u2018public\u2019 and the \u2018private\u2019. The \u2018intimate\u2019 sphere is no longer one that is outside the purview of states; indeed the \u2018private\u2019 or the \u2018intimate\u2019 is often co-produced as a corollary of the public face of a state\u2019s legitimacy. Nationalism and patriotism are heavily grounded in issues pertaining to culture and sexuality, often thought of as \u2018private\u2019. This course will provide a historical and sociological perspective to how sexual governance \u2013 the control of women\u2019s sexuality, conjugality and the definition of \u2018marriage\u2019 and the \u2018family\u2019 by a patriarchal state shows that the state has always concerned itself with the intimate lives of its citizens.", "credits": "3 (3-0-0)"}
