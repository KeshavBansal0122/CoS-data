{"department": "Department of Humanities and Social Sciences", "name": "HUL871 Ethnographic Perspectives on the State", "description": "Traditionally studied by political scientists, the state has increasingly come to be regarded as an object of anthropological study. Ethnographic perspectives on the state seek to open up the state to critical scrutiny, dislodging it as a monolithic conceptual or territorial apparatus. These studies allow us to think of the state beyond governmentality or bureaucracy, to engaging with the multiple ways in which state \u2018effects\u2019 shape our engagement with it. How does the \u2018idea\u2019 of the state constrain the way in which we \u2018think\u2019 the state? What are the ethnographic sites through which the state emerges as an object of study, e.g., bureaucracy, law, sexuality, marriage, citizenship, borders etc? The course will consist of seminars designed around a set of readings, which will be discussed in detail each week.", "credits": "3 (3-0-0)"}
