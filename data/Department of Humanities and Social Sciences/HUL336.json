{"department": "Department of Humanities and Social Sciences", "name": "HUL336 Workshop in Creative Writing", "description": "The course will begin by seeking to distinguish the notion of \u2018creative\u2019 writing. It will contrast this heterogeneous category with other kinds of writing such as the \u2018functional\u2019 writing found in text-books and reportage. Through an analysis of various techniques of writing - in master-texts as well as students\u2019 own productions - the course will explore why and how literary texts continue to be a prime source of emotional and intellectual stimulation across cultures. As far as possible, the course will focus on contemporary writing, given that writers write in the \u2018here and now\u2019 even as they imagine the future or return to past memories. Selected readings will be used to focus students\u2019 attention on that most difficult of problems: to acquire a style of writing that makes a writer\u2019s \u2018voice\u2019 both unique and universal. Finally, students will be required to write in some genre(s) of their choice. These genres will include the classic areas of poetry, fiction and play-writing but will neither exclude non-fiction genres like the essay and biography nor forms of writing thrown up by the \u2018new media\u2019 such as blogs, photo-essays and narrative-writing for story- boards and video-games.", "credits": "3 (3-0-0)", "pre": "Any Two courses from HUL2XX category", "allocPref": "HUL231, HUL232, HUL235, HUL236, HUL237, HUL240, HUL239"}
