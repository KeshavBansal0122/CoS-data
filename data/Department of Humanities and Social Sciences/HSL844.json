This course will cover the cognitive underpinnings of computational models of word similarity, ontologies such as WordNet and frameworks such as Abstract meaning Representation (for sentence meaning). The course will also examine applications of such models for carrying out natural language processing tasks like inference and entailment.", "credits": "3 (3-0-0)", "pre": "HSL522, or a similar programming course, HUL242 or HSL541, HSL748"}
